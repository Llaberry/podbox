//! `TOOL.md` section 6.3: layers, whiteouts, ownership sidecar, path safety.
//! Milestone M2, [`TODO/milestones.md`](../../../TODO/milestones.md) T-1103 and
//! [`TODO/extract.md`](../../../TODO/extract.md) T-0301 to T-0307.
//!
//! ⭐ **The single highest-risk component. Four separate tools in the corpus
//! stop here, all at the same wall, and the wall is `chown` to an id the user
//! namespace does not map.**
//!
//! Seven rules decide whether this crate is right rather than merely finished,
//! and each is one entry:
//!
//! 1. extraction is **in-process and at entry level**, never through system
//!    `tar` and never through a library's `unpack()` ([`apply`], T-0301);
//! 2. ownership is **never restored by default**; the image's intent goes in a
//!    sidecar keyed by path ([`sidecar`], T-0302);
//! 3. a whiteout is matched on the **basename**, never with a path glob
//!    ([`whiteout`], T-0303);
//! 4. an entry that resolves outside the destination is **refused**, including
//!    through a symlink the same layer created ([`safety`], T-0304);
//! 5. an absolute symlink target is **rootfs-relative**, not a refusal
//!    ([`safety::rebase_symlink_target`], T-0305);
//! 6. owner bits are **widened between layers**, or the second layer fails
//!    ([`apply`], T-0306);
//! 7. whiteouts are applied **before** their own layer's entries, and hard
//!    links and symlinks are preserved ([`remove`], T-0307).
//!
//! ⛔ **The sidecar changes no kernel permission check.** A file recorded as
//! `gid 42` is owned on disk by the id that extracted it, and every access
//! check the kernel makes uses that one. Presenting the sidecar as though it
//! restored ownership would be podbox telling the exact class of lie it exists
//! to refuse.
