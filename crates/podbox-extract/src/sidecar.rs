//! `TODO/extract.md` T-0302: ownership-neutral extraction, plus the record of
//! what the image meant.
//!
//! ⭐ **The wall this crate exists to survive.** `chown` and `lchown` to an
//! unmapped id return **`EINVAL`**, not `EPERM`, and that is where GNU tar,
//! containers/storage's layer applier, Apptainer's Go unpacker, pacman's
//! `DownloadUser` and rurima's `tar -xpf` all stop. The wall itself is at
//! `references/containers__storage/tree/pkg/archive/archive.go:798-811`: with
//! `chownOpts` nil it takes the ids straight from the tar header and calls
//! `idtools.SafeLchown`. The switch is at
//! `references/containers__storage/tree/pkg/archive/archive.go:1104`.
//!
//! `/etc/shadow` is the usual first casualty because it is `root:shadow`, gid
//! 42, and that is measured rather than assumed:
//! `experiments/results/whiteout-contract.txt` check B reads
//! `-rw-r----- 0/42 ... etc/shadow` out of a pinned `alpine` image.
//!
//! ⛔ **Never restore ownership by default.** The design to copy is udocker's,
//! which is ownership-neutral *by construction* rather than by recovery:
//! `references/indigo-dc__udocker/tree/udocker/container/structure.py:285-287`.
//!
//! The sidecar buys three things `--no-same-owner` alone does not: faithful
//! re-export, an honest answer to a workload that asks who owns a file, and a
//! diagnostic that names the gap.
//!
//! ⛔ **It changes no kernel permission check and must never be presented as if
//! it does.** A file recorded here as `gid 42` is owned by the extracting id on
//! disk, and every access check the kernel makes uses the latter.
