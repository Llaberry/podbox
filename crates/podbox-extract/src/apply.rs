//! The extraction itself: `TODO/extract.md` T-0301, T-0306 and T-0307.
//!
//! ⛔ **Entry level, never `unpack()`.** T-0301: shelling out to `tar` inherits
//! its ownership semantics, its exit codes and its path behaviour, and that is
//! how the ownership wall reaches five separate tools rather than one.
//! `references/RuriOSS__rurima/tree/src/archive.c:95` builds a `tar` argument
//! vector containing `-xpf`, which preserves permissions and ownership, and
//! that is where its `docker pull` dies.
//! `references/indigo-dc__udocker/tree/udocker/container/structure.py:285-287`
//! also shells out and survives only because it passes `--no-same-owner` and
//! `--no-same-permissions`. **The flags are the mechanism; the shell-out is
//! not.** A library's `unpack()` convenience is the same mistake in-process: it
//! makes the ownership, permission and path decisions this crate exists to
//! make.
//!
//! ⭐ **The layer order is more precise than "whiteouts after each layer".**
//! `references/indigo-dc__udocker/tree/udocker/container/structure.py:279`
//! applies layer N's whiteouts to the accumulated tree **before** extracting N,
//! which is the order that lets a layer both delete a path and recreate it. The
//! opposite order deletes what the same layer just wrote.
