//! Which instrument answered: this machine, or an emulator standing in for it.
//!
//! [`TODO/enter.md`](../../../TODO/enter.md) T-0506, point 5.
//!
//! ⛔ **A probe run under `qemu-user` measures the emulator, and printing its
//! rung as the machine's is the exact lie podbox exists to refuse.** Measured on
//! 2026-09-09, `experiments/results/multiarch.txt` clause 4: `qemu-aarch64`
//! answers `EINVAL` to `clone(CLONE_NEWNS)`, `ENOSYS` to `fsmount` and
//! `move_mount`, and reports `Seccomp: 0` and `NoNewPrivs: 0` however the host
//! is confined. Every one of those is a statement about QEMU.
//!
//! ⚠ **It became reachable by an ordinary user when podbox stopped being one
//! architecture**: `podbox run --platform linux/arm64` on an amd64 host executes
//! its payload, and any `podbox probe` inside it, under precisely this emulator.
//!
//! ## What can actually be detected, measured rather than assumed
//!
//! ⭐ Measured on 2026-09-09 by running the arm64 rootfs's own tools under
//! `qemu-aarch64-static` on this amd64 host:
//!
//! | asked | answer under the emulator | usable? |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `/proc/cpuinfo` | `model name: ARMv8 Processor rev 0 (v8l)` | ⛔ no, emulated |
//! | `readlink /proc/self/exe` | the guest binary's own path | ⛔ no, emulated |
//! | `/proc/self/maps` | guest mappings only; qemu's own are filtered out | ⛔ no |
//! | `ls /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` | the **host's** registrations | ⭐ yes |
//!
//! ⛔ **So the answer is conditional, and it says so.** podbox cannot prove it
//! is running natively; what it can establish is that this machine routes
//! binaries of podbox's own architecture through an interpreter, which is what
//! [`Interpreter::Emulated`] reports. The other state is
//! [`Interpreter::NoEvidence`] and it carries what was checked, because "no
//! evidence of an emulator" and "measured natively" are different sentences and
//! `TODO/probe.md` T-0109 rule 1 forbids collapsing them.
