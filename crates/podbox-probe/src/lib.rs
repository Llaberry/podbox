//! `TOOL.md` section 6.1: the probe set, disposable children, mode selection.
//! The work is in [`TODO/probe.md`](../../../TODO/probe.md), T-0101 to T-0110.
//!
//! ⭐ **Four rules decide whether this crate is right rather than merely
//! finished**, and each is one entry:
//!
//! 1. every probe runs in a disposable child ([`child`], T-0101);
//! 2. the errno is recorded, never a boolean ([`sys::Errno`], T-0101);
//! 3. "could not run" is a third state and never reads as "denied"
//!    ([`verdict::Verdict::Skip`], T-0109);
//! 4. the controls travel with the bogus-argument discriminator, so a probe
//!    that has stopped discriminating says so ([`select::Selection`], T-0102).
//!
//! ⛔ No dependencies. `TODO/deps.md` T-0901 rules that the section 6.1 probe
//! set is declared by hand first and the binary measured, before a syscall
//! crate is considered against that number.
