//! The disposable child. `TODO/probe.md` T-0101: every probe runs in a freshly
//! forked child, because a successful `unshare`, `chroot` or `setuid` mutates
//! the prober and several of them have no undo.
//!
//! The shape is `references/compforge__pathshim/tree/src/main.rs:103-118`:
//! re-exec `/proc/self/exe` with a private argument and take the verdict from
//! the child. podbox adds one thing pathshim does not need: the child speaks
//! its errno on stdout as well as setting its exit status, and the parent
//! **cross-checks the two**. `TODO/probe.md` T-0109's first rule is that a
//! child sets its exit status from the operation or the parent does not read a
//! verdict from it; a child that disagrees with itself has not established one
//! either, so that is a `skip` and never a denial.
//!
//! ⛔ The fork is `clone(2)` with no `CLONE_VM`, not `std::process::Command`.
//! `TOOL.md` section 6.1's minimum set needs `clone(CLONE_NEWNS)` and
//! `clone(CLONE_NEWUSER)` to be *attempted with those flags*, and the standard
//! library offers no way to set them. One spawn path serves both kinds of
//! probe rather than two that would drift.
