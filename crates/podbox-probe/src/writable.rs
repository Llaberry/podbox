//! `TODO/probe.md` T-0104: probe the write allowlist by writing, for blocks
//! and inodes both.
//!
//! ⛔ `{/tmp, /dev/shm, /workspace, /state}` is one machine's allowlist.
//! `TOOL.md` section 0 records that it has never been verified anywhere a
//! reader can re-run. The set below is a set of **candidates**, and what this
//! module reports is the set obtained.
//!
//! ⛔ A real write, never `access(W_OK)`. `access` consults the capability set,
//! which reports every bit on this class of runtime and therefore answers the
//! wrong question.
