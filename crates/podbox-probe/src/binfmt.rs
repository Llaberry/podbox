//! What this machine's `binfmt_misc` registrations say, read rather than assumed.
//!
//! [`TODO/enter.md`](../../../TODO/enter.md) T-0506.
//!
//! ⭐ **This is the mechanism docker and podman use.** `binfmt_misc` lets the
//! kernel hand an ELF it cannot execute to a registered interpreter, which for a
//! foreign architecture is `qemu-user`. podbox reads the registrations out of
//! `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` and reports what it found; it never registers one,
//! because registering is a machine-wide change and podbox is not the machine's
//! owner.
//!
//! ⛔ **It lives in `podbox-probe` because two very different callers need it,
//! and a second copy would be the copy that drifts.** `podbox-enter` asks "can
//! this machine execute a foreign image, and how" ([`super::interp`] does not);
//! [`super::interp`] asks the mirror-image question, "is an interpreter
//! registered for MY OWN architecture, so is this measurement the emulator's".
//!
//! ⭐ **`/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` is a real host file and `qemu-user` does not
//! emulate it**, which is what makes the second question answerable at all.
//! Measured on 2026-09-09: under `qemu-aarch64-static`, `/proc/cpuinfo` reports
//! an ARMv8 processor and `readlink /proc/self/exe` names the guest binary, so
//! both are the emulator's answers; `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` is the host's.
