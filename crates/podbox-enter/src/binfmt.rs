//! Whether this machine can execute a foreign-architecture payload, and how.

//! [`TODO/enter.md`](../../../TODO/enter.md) T-0506.
//!
//! ⭐ **This is the mechanism docker and podman use, read rather than assumed.**
//! `binfmt_misc` lets the kernel hand an ELF it cannot execute to a registered
//! interpreter, which for a foreign architecture is `qemu-user`. podbox reads
//! the registrations out of `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` and reports what it
//! found; it never registers one, because registering is a machine-wide change
//! and podbox is not the machine's owner.
//!
//! ⛔ **The `F` flag is the whole question for a chroot.** Without it the
//! kernel opens the interpreter **by path at exec time**, which is a path inside
//! the new root, so a chroot with no qemu in it fails. With it the interpreter
//! is opened when the registration is made and held, so it works inside any
//! chroot. Measured on 2026-09-09, `experiments/results/multiarch.txt` clause 5:
//! an `F` registration ran an aarch64 binary in a bare chroot containing
//! nothing but that binary.

// ⭐ The reader moved to `podbox-probe` and is re-exported here, so every
// existing caller keeps one name for it and there is exactly one parser.
// `podbox_probe::interp` needs the same registrations to answer the mirror
