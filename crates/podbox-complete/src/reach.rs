//! Does this mirror speak HTTPS? One bounded question, asked once per host.

//! ⭐ [`TODO/complete.md`](../../../TODO/complete.md) T-0411 clause 4:
//! **verify before rewriting**. Rewriting a source that then 404s is worse than
//! the hang it was meant to fix, because the failure no longer names the cause.
//!
//! ⛔ Bounded, always. [`TODO/RULES.md`](../../../TODO/RULES.md) section 8: a
//! runtime whose audience is automated may not wait unbounded, and this probe
//! runs on the path to starting a container.
//!
//! ⚠ **Any HTTP response is a yes**, 404 included. The question is whether the
//! host terminates TLS on 443, not whether it serves `/`. A connect failure, a
//! TLS failure or a timeout is a no, and the reason travels with it so the
//! banner can say which.
