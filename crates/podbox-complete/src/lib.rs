//! `TOOL.md` section 6.4: environment completion. Milestone M5,
//! [`TODO/milestones.md`](../../../TODO/milestones.md) T-1106 and
//! [`TODO/complete.md`](../../../TODO/complete.md) T-0401 to T-0411.
//!
//! ⭐ **The layer that makes the runtime useful without the user learning
//! anything.** An extracted OCI rootfs is not a working environment on a
//! machine that denies `mknod`, `mount` and `chown`: it has no `/dev/null`, its
//! resolver is the build host's, its `/etc/mtab` is a symlink into a `/proc`
//! that is not mounted, and on a glibc rootfs whether anything reads
//! `/etc/passwd` at all is decided by a file most images do not ship.
//!
//! Three rules decide whether this crate is right rather than merely finished:
//!
//! 1. ⛔ **Every write goes through [`write::Root`]**, which resolves each
//!    component with symlinks refused and replaces by unlink-then-create. T-0405
//!    is that mechanism and not a special case for `/etc/mtab`;
//!    ⚠ and where a fixup needs a COMMAND rather than a write, this crate
//!    returns a [`Step`] and the caller runs it. T-0412: a library that forks
//!    and chroots is one no test can drive;
//! 2. ⛔ **Every fixup is reported, on the banner, per file.** podbox has
//!    edited a file inside somebody else's image and the payload can see it.
//!    [`TODO/cli.md`](../../../TODO/cli.md) T-0804's honesty rules have no
//!    exception for a helpful edit;
//! 3. ⛔ **A fixup never changes the payload's exit code.** T-0409 and T-0802:
//!    the exit code is the payload's answer, and a runtime that improves it is
//!    lying in the one field an automated caller reads first.
//!
//! ⚠ **It is idempotent and it runs on every `run` and `exec`.** The rootfs is
//! content-addressed and shared between containers
//! ([`TODO/image.md`](../../../TODO/image.md) T-0204), so a fixup made once at
//! extraction time would be one container's decision imposed on every later
//! one. Running it every time also repairs the failure T-0401 exists for: a
//! `/dev/null` that a previous payload turned into a growing regular file is
//! truncated back to nothing.
