//! `TODO/image.md` T-0203: check blocks **and inodes**, before any download and
//! again before any extraction, and name the destination in the message.
//!
//! ⭐ The defect this exists to avoid is in the corpus at file and line.
//! `references/mhx__dwarfs/tree/src/utility/filesystem_extractor.cpp:544-552`
//! takes `rv` from `write_range_data`, which returns a libarchive
//! `la_ssize_t`, then formats it into `"short write: {} != {}"` as though it
//! were a byte count. `-20` is `ARCHIVE_WARN`, a status code; the underlying
//! `archive_errno` is `ENOSPC`. The message names neither the errno nor the
//! path, so the reader learns nothing they can act on.
//!
//! ⚠ The same trap is in the corpus as a shipped default:
//! `references/VHSgunzo__memfd-exec/tree/src/executable.rs:580-584` falls back
//! to `env::temp_dir()`, then `/dev/shm`, then `$HOME/.cache`, with no space
//! check on any of them.
//!
//! ⛔ Refuse up front rather than streaming until `ENOSPC`. A partial
//! extraction has to be cleaned up on a filesystem that is already full, which
//! is the state in which cleanup is least likely to work.
