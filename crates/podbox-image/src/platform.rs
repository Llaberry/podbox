//! Which `os/arch/variant` podbox asks a registry for, and how it decides.
//!
//! [`TODO/image.md`](../../../TODO/image.md) T-0212. Until 2026-09-09 this was
//! two `const`s, `OS = "linux"` and `ARCH = "amd64"`, so podbox built for
//! aarch64 would still have pulled an amd64 rootfs and handed the payload an
//! `Exec format error` with nothing to say about why.
//!
//! ⛔ **The host's architecture is read at compile time and the platform is
//! decided at run time, and those are different things.** `HOST` below is what
//! this binary was built for, which is the only honest default. What podbox
//! actually asks for is [`Platform::wanted`], which a `--platform` flag or an
//! environment variable may override, because a caller on an amd64 host asking
//! for `linux/arm64` is doing something deliberate and docker lets them.
