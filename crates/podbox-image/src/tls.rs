//! The trust root for every request podbox makes.
//!
//! ⭐ The host bundle first, `webpki-roots` as the fallback. `Cargo.toml`
//! records why both are pinned: a machine whose egress is intercepted has a
//! private CA in its own bundle and nowhere else, and a client that trusts only
//! the compiled-in roots fails there with an error naming a certificate rather
//! than a proxy. A machine with no bundle at all is the opposite case and is
//! why the compiled-in set is not simply dropped.
//!
//! ⭐ **There IS a "skip verification" path, and it is never taken by default.**
//! [`crate::transport::Policy`] decides, from a `--tls-verify=false`, an
//! `--insecure-registry`, `$PODBOX_INSECURE_REGISTRIES` or the config file, and
//! every use of it is announced on stderr.
//! [`TODO/image.md`](../../../TODO/image.md) T-0213.
//!
//! ⚠ **This paragraph used to say the opposite, and it cited a rule that does
//! not exist.** It read: "There is no skip-verification path here, not behind a
//! flag and not behind an environment variable. `docs/security/remote-ops.md`
//! and the environment note in `docs/AGENTS.md` both say never to disable
//! verification". Checked on 2026-09-09: `remote-ops.md` says nothing about TLS
//! at all, and `docs/AGENTS.md`'s note is an instruction to the **agent** about
//! this development container's intercepting proxy, not a rule about what
//! podbox may offer. ⛔ "A switch that exists gets set" is a real argument and
//! is answered rather than dismissed: the switch is off by default, it is
//! per-registry rather than global, and it prints a line naming the registry
//! every time it is used, so a set switch is visible in the transcript of an
//! automated caller rather than inferred from a missing failure.
