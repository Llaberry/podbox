//! `TOOL.md` section 6.2: registry client, manifests, store, digests.
//! Milestone M1, [`TODO/milestones.md`](../../../TODO/milestones.md) T-1102 and
//! [`TODO/image.md`](../../../TODO/image.md) T-0201 to T-0204.
//!
//! ⭐ **Four rules decide whether this crate is right rather than merely
//! finished**, and each is one entry:
//!
//! 1. HTTPS only, with no plain-HTTP fallback at any layer ([`registry`],
//!    T-0201). tcp/80 egress is broken on the runtime podbox targets, so a
//!    fallback hangs instead of failing;
//! 2. every blob is verified **as it is written** and reaches `blobs/` only on
//!    success ([`digest::Verifier`], [`store`], T-0202);
//! 3. blocks **and inodes** are checked before any download, and the refusal
//!    names the destination, the free amount, the required amount and the unit
//!    ([`space`], T-0203);
//! 4. a GC cannot delete what a container is using, and says which it skipped
//!    ([`store::Lock`], T-0204).
//!
//! ⛔ **This crate is the first member to take a `[workspace.dependencies]`
//! pin.** Every one of them was ruled by a measured `cargo bloat` delta in
//! `TODO/deps.md` T-0901 to T-0910, and `experiments/110-bloat-delta.sh` is the
//! instrument. Adding one that was not measured is not a small change.
